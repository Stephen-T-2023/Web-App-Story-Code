/*
  - This `textData` object holds all the narrative choices and branching paths for the game's story.
  
  - Each id in the object represents a state in the storyline, like "start", "accepted", or "rejected". 
  - For each state, there is corresponding text string that provides the narrative description at that point.
  - `option1text` and `option2text` are the displayed text for the two available choices the player can make at each decision point.
  - `option1path` and `option2path` define the next state (or path) based on the player's choice, linking to another id within textData to continue the story.
  
  - If `option1path` or `option2path` is `null`, it means that there are no further choices for that branch (the end of that path).
